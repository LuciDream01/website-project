                <p>This is your safe space to start fresh,
                even if you feel stuck or overwhelmed by
                programming. Here, I share honest stories,
                practical tips, and motivational insights
                to help you break through self-doubt and
                build your path toward becoming a confident
                software engineer. If you’re ready to turn
                frustration into progress and dreams into
                code, you’re in the right place. Let’s take
                this journey together — one step at a time.</p>

            <h3>My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>If you had told me a few years ago that I’d be writing code for a living, I might’ve laughed (or cried, depending on how stressed I was). But here I am — a software engineer — and I want to share how I got here. This is my story of curiosity, confusion, countless bugs, and ultimately, growth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-2">
            <h3>Where It All Started</h3>
            <p>My journey began with a simple question: “How do apps actually work?” That spark of curiosity led me to Google, YouTube tutorials, and my very first lines of code in HTML and CSS. They were small, but seeing something I created appear in a browser felt like magic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-3">
            <h3>The Struggles Were Real</h3>
            <p>Learning to code wasn’t easy. I juggled online courses, personal projects, and more error messages than I can count. There were moments I wanted to give up — when nothing worked, when I doubted myself, and when I felt completely lost. But I kept going. I reminded myself that everyone starts somewhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-4">
            <h3>Turning Point</h3>
            <p>What really changed things for me was consistency. I started building small projects: a to-do app, a portfolio site, even a basic game. I also joined online communities, asked questions, and learned from others. Slowly but surely, it all began to click.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-5">
            <h3>Landing My First Role</h3>
            <p>After months (okay, years) of learning, building, and refining my skills, I applied for my first software engineering role. The interview process was nerve-wracking, but I leaned on my projects and the story behind them. Eventually, I got the offer — and I’ll never forget how it felt to see “Congratulations!” in my inbox.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-6">
            <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
            <p>This journey has taught me more than just coding. It taught me resilience, patience, and the power of continuous learning. Being a software engineer isn’t just about writing code — it’s about solving problems, thinking logically, and never stopping your growth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-7">
            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>I’m still learning every day — new languages, frameworks, and better ways to think about systems. But now, I get to do it as part of a team, on real-world products, and with a deeper sense of purpose.

            If you’re thinking about starting your own journey into tech, here’s my advice: Start small. Stay curious. Don’t be afraid to fail. And most importantly — keep going.</p>
