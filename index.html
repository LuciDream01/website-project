                <p>Hey, I’m just a regular student who used to keep his head down and go home right after class. I wasn’t always the type to speak up, or even stay a little longer after school just to hang out. But things changed — slowly, unexpectedly, and in ways I didn’t see coming.

This blog is where I look back on how I changed during my time at STI.
Not to be dramatic — just real.
From being that quiet guy in the corner to someone who’s finally starting to enjoy life, speak up, and be seen.

If you're here to read a story that’s still unfolding, welcome in.

            <h3>The Class I Slept Through: When Dreams Missed the Deadline</h3>
            <p>Back in junior high, during grades 9 and 10, school didn’t feel like school anymore. The world went into lockdown because of COVID-19, and just like that, everything turned into an online routine. No uniforms, no crowded hallways — just screens, links, and cameras turned off. I’m not proud of it, but I slept through most of my online classes. It felt harmless at the time, just trying to survive the boredom. But it hit me later — hard. I didn’t get into the University of Makati (UMak), which was where everyone I knew was going. It crushed me knowing I missed that shot because of decisions I made during lockdown. Everyone had a place; I felt like I was left behind. That regret stuck with me, and honestly, it still teaches me something today.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-2">
            <h3>Reset: Learning to Breathe Again at STI</h3>
            <p>After UMak didn’t work out, I enrolled at STI College Global City for senior high. Grade 11 wasn’t anything special at first. In fact, it felt... empty. I wasn’t used to the noise of real life again after being stuck at home for so long. I wasn’t ready to talk, to connect, to just “be” with people. I’d go to class, sit in silence, then leave right after. No friends, no attachments. I was still figuring out how to be “outside” again. It was a weird chapter — quiet but necessary. I didn’t realize it then, but it was my personal reboot, slowly bringing me back to the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-3">
            <h3>The Girl at the Door: A Glimpse I Couldn’t Forget</h3>
            <p>It was the first day of Grade 11 when something unusual happened. I opened the classroom door, and my eyes landed on her — this girl who, for some reason, stood out instantly. I didn’t even know her name, but she became someone unforgettable. I don’t want to go too deep into that story yet, because it’s still unfolding in small ways. That year, I didn’t have a circle. I still went straight home after class. But that one glance — that one moment — stayed with me. It was the beginning of something I couldn’t quite name.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-4">
            <h3>Out of My Shell and Into the Spotlight: How Grade 12 Changed Me</h3>
            <p>Grade 12 was the shift. It was the first time I felt things starting to move in my life. There was this performance project called ILS — a collaborative effort across subjects. Sounds boring? It wasn’t. It pushed me beyond the edge of my comfort zone. That was when I met Prince, my first real friend in that school. We clicked, maybe because of shared interests, or just a mutual understanding of what it means to keep things lowkey. We’d part ways after class — he’d take a commute, I’d walk home. Quiet friendship, but it mattered. And slowly, I started coming out of my shell.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-5">
            <h3>Stage Lights and Confidence: The Day I Owned the Crowd</h3>
            <p>There’s something about performing in front of a crowd that changes you. I was part of the ILS performance cast, acting in front of hundreds of people I didn’t even know. The rush, the nerves, the applause — all of it flipped a switch inside me. Suddenly, the fear I used to have — of being noticed, of being seen — faded. I thought, “If I can act on stage, why should I be embarrassed in a room with 38 classmates?” That one performance gave me something school rarely teaches: self-esteem. From that day on, I didn’t hide anymore. I started speaking up, showing up, being me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-6">
            <h3>New Faces, Same Me — But Louder</h3>
            <p>First year of college brought in new classmates, new classes, and a fresh start. But this time, I wasn’t the silent kid anymore. I already had connections from high school, and the confidence I gained from Grade 12 helped me a lot. I talked more, joked around, made friends. I wasn’t afraid to approach people anymore. I could walk up, say “wazzup,” and just vibe. It wasn’t about popularity; it was about finally feeling like I belonged somewhere. The best part? I didn’t have to pretend to be someone else. I was still me — just a louder, prouder version.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-7">
            <h3>Admiring From Afar: Becoming Someone Who Belongs Beside Her</h3>
            <p>Now I’m in my second year of college — and honestly, I’m proud of where I am. I’ve built real friendships, I have a circle I enjoy being with, and I’m no longer the person who rushes home the moment class ends. I’ve learned to stay, to be present, to laugh a little longer. Life’s good — not perfect, but good. <br>
<br>
Lately, I’ve found myself thinking about someone from my past — the girl I first noticed the moment I opened the door on my first day of Grade 11. She’s still unforgettable. Not just because of how she looks, but because of how she is — driven, smart, focused. She’s not just someone I admire from a distance anymore; she’s a reminder of the kind of person I want to become.<br>
<br>
But here’s the thing — I don’t want to be like her. I want to be someone who’s worthy of standing beside her. Not in a romantic sense (at least, not now), but as someone who’s grown enough, strong enough, and real enough to match that kind of energy. She inspires me — not to change who I am, but to evolve into who I could be.

And maybe one day, when paths align, I’ll walk through another door — and this time, I’ll be ready to stand next to her, not just admire her from afar.</p>
